How can I assist you today?\nwhat is faceted search and how does it work in tantivy?\nFaceted search is a technique used in information retrieval systems to allow users to refine their search results by applying multiple filters based on different attributes (facets) of the data. These facets can include categories, tags, dates, ranges, and other metadata that help narrow down the search results to more relevant items.\n\n### How Faceted Search Works\n\n1. **Indexing**: During the indexing phase, documents are analyzed and indexed with various facets. For example, an e-commerce site might index products with facets like category, brand, price range, and customer ratings.\n\n2. **Querying**: When a user performs a search, the system retrieves the initial set of results based on the query terms.\n\n3. **Faceting**: The system then calculates the counts of documents that fall into each facet category within the search results. This allows users to see how many results match each facet and to further refine their search by selecting one or more facets.\n\n4. **Filtering**: Users can apply these facet filters to narrow down the search results. The system updates the results and facet counts dynamically based on the selected filters.\n\n### Faceted Search in Tantivy\n\n[Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) is a full-text search engine library written in Rust. It is designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use. Tantivy supports faceted search, allowing you to build powerful search applications with filtering capabilities.\n\n#### Setting Up Faceted Search in Tantivy\n\n1. **Define Schema**: When creating the schema for your index, you need to define the fields that will be used as facets. These fields should be indexed and stored.\n\n    ```rust\n    use tantivy::schema::*;\n    \n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    schema_builder.add_facet_field(\"category\");\n    schema_builder.add_facet_field(\"brand\");\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n    ```\n\n2. **Indexing Documents**: When adding documents to the index, you need to include the facet fields.\n\n    ```rust\n    use tantivy::Index;\n    use tantivy::schema::Facet;\n    \n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n    \n    let mut doc = Document::default();\n    doc.add_text(title, \"The Great Gatsby\");\n    doc.add_text(body, \"A novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald.\");\n    doc.add_facet(category, Facet::from(\"/books/fiction\"));\n    doc.add_facet(brand, Facet::from(\"/brand/penguin\"));\n    \n    index_writer.add_document(doc);\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n    ```\n\n3. **Searching with Facets**: When performing a search, you can request facet counts and apply facet filters.\n\n    ```rust\n    use tantivy::query::QueryParser;\n    use tantivy::collector::FacetCollector;\n    use tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n    \n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    \n    let query_parser = QueryParser::for_index(&index, vec![title, body]);\n    let query = query_parser.parse_query(\"Gatsby\")?;\n    \n    let mut facet_collector = FacetCollector::for_field(\"category\");\n    facet_collector.add_facet(\"/books\");\n    \n    let top_docs = searcher.search(&query, &(facet_collector, TopDocs::with_limit(10)))?;\n    \n    let facet_counts = facet_collector.facet_counts();\n    for (facet, count) in facet_counts {\n        println!(\"{}: {}\", facet.to_path_string(), count);\n    }\n    \n    for (score, doc_address) in top_docs {\n        let retrieved_doc = searcher.doc(doc_address)?;\n        println!(\"Document: {:?}\", retrieved_doc);\n    }\n    ```\n\nIn this example, the `FacetCollector` is used to collect facet counts for the \"category\" field. The search results and facet counts are then printed out.\n\nBy using faceted search in Tantivy, you can build efficient and user-friendly search interfaces that allow users to refine their search results based on various attributes. This can greatly improve the search experience and help users find the information they are looking for more quickly and accurately.\n\nCan you tell me how postings are stored for each term if the term appears in multiple documnts?\n\nCan you tell me how postings are stored for each term if the term appears in multiple documnts?\nIn search engines like Tantivy, the term \"postings\" refers to the data structure that stores information about which documents contain a particular term and where within those documents the term appears. This is crucial for efficient search and retrieval operations.\n\n### Postings List\n\nA postings list (or inverted list) is the core data structure used to store this information. For each term in the index, there is a postings list that contains entries for each document that contains the term. Each entry typically includes:\n\n1. **Document ID**: The unique identifier of the document that contains the term.\n2. **Term Frequency (optional)**: The number of times the term appears in the document.\n3. **Positions (optional)**: The positions within the document where the term appears. This is useful for phrase queries and proximity searches.\n\n### Storage of Postings in Tantivy\n\nTantivy uses a compressed format to store postings lists efficiently. Here's a high-level overview of how postings are stored:\n\n1. **Term Dictionary**: Tantivy maintains a term dictionary that maps each term to its corresponding postings list. The term dictionary is often implemented as a finite state transducer (FST) for efficient lookups.\n\n2. **Postings List Compression**: To save space, postings lists are compressed. Common compression techniques include:\n   - **Delta Encoding**: Instead of storing absolute document IDs, the differences (deltas) between consecutive document IDs are stored. This often results in smaller numbers, which can be more efficiently compressed.\n   - **Variable Byte Encoding**: This technique uses a variable number of bytes to encode integers, allowing smaller numbers to take up less space.\n   - **Bit Packing**: This technique packs multiple small integers into a single machine word, reducing the overhead of storing each integer separately.\n\n3. **Block-Based Storage**: Postings lists are often divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately. This allows for efficient access and decompression of postings data.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider an example where the term \"example\" appears in three documents with IDs 1, 3, and 7. The postings list for \"example\" might look like this:\n\n- Document IDs: [1, 3, 7]\n\nUsing delta encoding, this would be stored as:\n\n- Deltas: [1, 2, 4] (since 3-1=2 and 7-3=4)\n\nThese deltas can then be further compressed using variable byte encoding or other techniques.\n\n### Query Processing\n\nWhen a query is executed, Tantivy retrieves the postings lists for the query terms from the term dictionary. It then processes these postings lists to find the documents that match the query. For example, in the case of an AND query, it would intersect the postings lists of the query terms to find documents that contain all the terms.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might interact with postings in Tantivy:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, Term};\nuse tantivy::query::QueryParser;\nuse tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 1\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 2\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Another example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 3\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Yet another example.\"));\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    // Search\n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    let query_parser = QueryParser::for_index(&index, vec![schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap(), schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap()]);\n    let query = query_parser.parse_query(\"example\")?;\n    let top_docs = searcher.search(&query, &TopDocs::with_limit(10))?;\n\n    // Print results\n    for (score, doc_address) in top_docs {\n        let retrieved_doc = searcher.doc(doc_address)?;\n        println!(\"Document: {:?}\", retrieved_doc);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a schema, create an index, add documents, and perform a search. The postings lists are managed internally by Tantivy, allowing for efficient search and retrieval.\n\nBy using these techniques, Tantivy can efficiently store and retrieve postings data, enabling fast and accurate search operations.\nI want to know moare about postings list compression and how the document ID is really stored in the postings list. Is there a limit to the document IDs you can store for a term?\n### Postings List Compression\n\nPostings list compression is a crucial aspect of search engine efficiency. The goal is to reduce the storage space required for the postings list while maintaining fast access and decompression times. Here are some common techniques used for compressing postings lists:\n\n1. **Delta Encoding**: Instead of storing absolute document IDs, the differences (deltas) between consecutive document IDs are stored. This often results in smaller numbers, which can be more efficiently compressed.\n\n    - Example:\n        - Document IDs: [1, 3, 7]\n        - Deltas: [1, 2, 4] (since 3-1=2 and 7-3=4)\n\n2. **Variable Byte Encoding (VByte)**: This technique uses a variable number of bytes to encode integers. Smaller numbers take up fewer bytes, which is efficient for delta-encoded values.\n\n    - Example:\n        - Delta: 2\n        - VByte Encoding: 00000010 (1 byte)\n\n3. **Simple-9 and Simple-16**: These are bit-packing techniques that pack multiple small integers into a single machine word. They use a fixed number of bits to represent each integer, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.\n\n4. **PForDelta (Patched Frame of Reference)**: This technique divides the postings list into blocks and compresses each block separately. It uses a fixed number of bits for most values and patches the exceptions.\n\n### Storage of Document IDs in Tantivy\n\nIn Tantivy, the document IDs are stored in a compressed format within the postings list. Here's a high-level overview of how this is done:\n\n1. **Term Dictionary**: Tantivy maintains a term dictionary that maps each term to its corresponding postings list. The term dictionary is often implemented as a finite state transducer (FST) for efficient lookups.\n\n2. **Postings List**: For each term, the postings list contains the document IDs where the term appears. These document IDs are delta-encoded and then compressed using techniques like Variable Byte Encoding or Simple-9.\n\n3. **Block-Based Storage**: The postings list is divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately. This allows for efficient access and decompression of postings data.\n\n### Example of Postings List Compression\n\nLet's consider an example where the term \"example\" appears in documents with IDs 1, 3, 7, 8, and 10. The postings list for \"example\" might look like this:\n\n- Document IDs: [1, 3, 7, 8, 10]\n\nUsing delta encoding, this would be stored as:\n\n- Deltas: [1, 2, 4, 1, 2] (since 3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, and 10-8=2)\n\nThese deltas can then be further compressed using Variable Byte Encoding:\n\n- VByte Encoding: [00000001, 00000010, 00000100, 00000001, 00000010]\n\n### Limitations on Document IDs\n\nIn Tantivy, the document ID is typically represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer (`u32`). This means that the maximum number of unique document IDs that can be stored is \\(2^{32} - 1\\), which is 4,294,967,295. This is usually sufficient for most applications, but it is a hard limit imposed by the data type used.\n\n### Practical Example in Tantivy\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might interact with postings in Tantivy:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, Term};\nuse tantivy::query::QueryParser;\nuse tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 1\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 2\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Another example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 3\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Yet another example.\"));\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    // Search\n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    let query_parser = QueryParser::for_index(&index, vec![schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap(), schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap()]);\n    let query = query_parser.parse_query(\"example\")?;\n    let top_docs = searcher.search(&query, &TopDocs::with_limit(10))?;\n\n    // Print results\n    for (score, doc_address) in top_docs {\n        let retrieved_doc = searcher.doc(doc_address)?;\n        println!(\"Document: {:?}\", retrieved_doc);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a schema, create an index, add documents, and perform a search. The postings lists are managed internally by Tantivy, allowing for efficient search and retrieval.\n\nBy using these compression techniques, Tantivy can efficiently store and retrieve postings data, enabling fast and accurate search operations. The limit on document IDs is determined by the data type used to represent them, which is typically a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nSo what will be the retrieved doc in this case? u32?\nIn Tantivy, the document ID is indeed represented as a `u32` (32-bit unsigned integer). This means that each document in the index is assigned a unique identifier within the range of 0 to \\(2^{32} - 1\\) (i.e., 0 to 4,294,967,295).\n\nWhen you retrieve a document using its document ID, you get back a `Document` object, which contains the fields and values that were indexed for that document. The document ID itself is used internally by Tantivy to manage and access documents efficiently.\n\n### Example of Retrieving a Document\n\nLet's revisit the example code to see how documents are retrieved and what the retrieved document looks like:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, Term};\nuse tantivy::query::QueryParser;\nuse tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 1\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 2\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Another example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 3\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Yet another example.\"));\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    // Search\n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    let query_parser = QueryParser::for_index(&index, vec![schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap(), schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap()]);\n    let query = query_parser.parse_query(\"example\")?;\n    let top_docs = searcher.search(&query, &TopDocs::with_limit(10))?;\n\n    // Print results\n    for (score, doc_address) in top_docs {\n        let retrieved_doc = searcher.doc(doc_address)?;\n        println!(\"Document: {:?}\", retrieved_doc);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Index Creation and Document Addition**:\n    - We define a schema with two fields: `title` and `body`.\n    - We create an in-memory index and add three documents to it.\n\n2. **Searching**:\n    - We create a `QueryParser` and parse a query for the term \"example\".\n    - We execute the search and collect the top 10 documents that match the query.\n\n3. **Retrieving and Printing Documents**:\n    - For each document in the search results, we retrieve the document using its document address (`doc_address`).\n    - We print the retrieved document.\n\n### Retrieved Document\n\nThe `retrieved_doc` is an instance of the `Document` struct, which contains the fields and values that were indexed for that document. The document ID itself is not directly exposed in the `Document` object but is used internally to fetch the document.\n\nHere's what the output might look like:\n\n```\nDocument: Document {\n    field_values: [\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(0),\n            value: Str(\"Example Document 1\")\n        },\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(1),\n            value: Str(\"This is an example.\")\n        }\n    ]\n}\nDocument: Document {\n    field_values: [\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(0),\n            value: Str(\"Example Document 2\")\n        },\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(1),\n            value: Str(\"Another example.\")\n        }\n    ]\n}\nDocument: Document {\n    field_values: [\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(0),\n            value: Str(\"Example Document 3\")\n        },\n        FieldValue {\n            field: Field(1),\n            value: Str(\"Yet another example.\")\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nEach `Document` object contains a list of `FieldValue` instances, where each `FieldValue` represents a field and its corresponding value in the document.\n\n### Summary\n\n- The document ID in Tantivy is a `u32` (32-bit unsigned integer).\n- The document ID is used internally to manage and access documents.\n- When you retrieve a document, you get a `Document` object that contains the fields and values indexed for that document.\n- The document ID itself is not directly exposed in the `Document` object but is used to fetch the document.\n\nThis design allows Tantivy to efficiently manage and retrieve documents while keeping the interface simple and intuitive for users.\nThere is also a 10million doc limit for segment creation right?\nYes, in Tantivy, there is a practical limit on the number of documents that can be stored in a single segment. This limit is set to 10 million documents per segment. This design choice is made to balance performance and manageability.\n\n### Why the 10 Million Document Limit?\n/file sstable/src\n\n1. **Performance**: Managing very large segments can become inefficient. By limiting the number of documents per segment, Tantivy ensures that operations like searching, merging, and updating remain performant.\n\n2. **Manageability**: Smaller segments are easier to manage and merge. When segments are too large, merging them can become a resource-intensive operation, potentially impacting the performance of the search engine.\n\n3. **Memory Usage**: Large segments can consume a significant amount of memory, especially during indexing and merging operations. By capping the number of documents per segment, Tantivy can better control memory usage.\n\n### How Segments Work in Tantivy\n\nTantivy uses a segmented architecture, similar to other search engines like Apache Lucene. Here's a brief overview of how segments work:\n\n1. **Indexing**: When documents are added to the index, they are initially stored in memory. Once the in-memory buffer reaches a certain size or a commit is called, the documents are flushed to disk as a new segment.\n\n2. **Segments**: Each segment is a self-contained index that contains a subset of the documents. Segments are immutable, meaning once they are written to disk, they are not modified.\n\n3. **Merging**: Over time, multiple segments are created. To optimize search performance and reduce the number of segments, Tantivy periodically merges smaller segments into larger ones. This process is called segment merging.\n\n4. **Search**: When a search query is executed, Tantivy searches across all segments and combines the results.\n\n### Handling the 10 Million Document Limit\n\nWhen the number of documents in a segment reaches the 10 million limit, Tantivy will start a new segment for additional documents. This ensures that no single segment exceeds the limit.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's an example of how you might interact with Tantivy, keeping in mind the segment limit:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, Term};\nuse tantivy::query::QueryParser;\nuse tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    for i in 0..10_000_001 {\n        index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => format!(\"Document {}\", i), schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    }\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    // Search\n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    let query_parser = QueryParser::for_index(&index, vec![schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap(), schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap()]);\n    let query = query_parser.parse_query(\"example\")?;\n    let top_docs = searcher.search(&query, &TopDocs::with_limit(10))?;\n\n    // Print results\n    for (score, doc_address) in top_docs {\n        let retrieved_doc = searcher.doc(doc_address)?;\n        println!(\"Document: {:?}\", retrieved_doc);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- Tantivy has a practical limit of 10 million documents per segment.\n- This limit helps balance performance, manageability, and memory usage.\n- When the limit is reached, Tantivy starts a new segment for additional documents.\n- Segments are immutable and periodically merged to optimize search performance.\n\nBy understanding and working within these limits, you can ensure that your Tantivy-based search application remains efficient and performant.\nnow tell me how does the u32 document id gets serialized?\nIn Tantivy, the `u32` document ID is serialized as part of the postings list, which is a core component of the inverted index. The serialization process involves encoding the document IDs in a compact and efficient manner to optimize both storage space and retrieval speed.\n\n### Serialization of Document IDs\n\n1. **Delta Encoding**: Document IDs are first delta-encoded. Instead of storing the absolute document IDs, the differences (deltas) between consecutive document IDs are stored. This often results in smaller numbers, which can be more efficiently compressed.\n\n    - Example:\n        - Document IDs: [1, 3, 7, 8, 10]\n        - Deltas: [1, 2, 4, 1, 2] (since 3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, and 10-8=2)\n\n2. **Variable Byte Encoding (VByte)**: The delta-encoded values are then serialized using Variable Byte Encoding. This technique uses a variable number of bytes to encode each integer, allowing smaller numbers to take up fewer bytes.\n\n    - Example:\n        - Delta: 2\n        - VByte Encoding: 00000010 (1 byte)\n\n3. **Block-Based Storage**: The postings list is divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately. This allows for efficient access and decompression of postings data.\n\n### Variable Byte Encoding (VByte)\n\nVariable Byte Encoding is a common technique used to serialize integers in a compact form. Here's how it works:\n\n- Each byte consists of 7 bits of data and 1 continuation bit.\n- The continuation bit indicates whether the byte is the last byte of the encoded integer (0) or if there are more bytes to follow (1).\n\nFor example, to encode the number 300:\n\n- Binary representation of 300: `100101100`\n- Split into 7-bit chunks: `0010110` `0100101`\n- Add continuation bits: `10100101` `00001011`\n- Resulting bytes: `0xA5` `0x0B`\n\n### Example Code for Variable Byte Encoding\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement Variable Byte Encoding in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn encode_varint(mut value: u32) -> Vec<u8> {\n    let mut bytes = Vec::new();\n    while value >= 0x80 {\n        bytes.push((value as u8 & 0x7F) | 0x80);\n        value >>= 7;\n    }\n    bytes.push(value as u8);\n    bytes\n}\n\nfn decode_varint(bytes: &[u8]) -> (u32, usize) {\n    let mut value = 0u32;\n    let mut shift = 0;\n    let mut i = 0;\n    for &byte in bytes {\n        value |= ((byte & 0x7F) as u32) << shift;\n        shift += 7;\n        i += 1;\n        if byte & 0x80 == 0 {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    (value, i)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let doc_ids = vec![1, 3, 7, 8, 10];\n    let deltas: Vec<u32> = doc_ids.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n        let delta = x - *state;\n        *state = x;\n        Some(delta)\n    }).collect();\n\n    let mut encoded_bytes = Vec::new();\n    for delta in deltas {\n        encoded_bytes.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Encoded bytes: {:?}\", encoded_bytes);\n\n    let mut decoded_deltas = Vec::new();\n    let mut i = 0;\n    while i < encoded_bytes.len() {\n        let (value, len) = decode_varint(&encoded_bytes[i..]);\n        decoded_deltas.push(value);\n        i += len;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Decoded deltas: {:?}\", decoded_deltas);\n}\n```\n\n### Integration with Tantivy\n\nIn Tantivy, the serialization and compression of document IDs are handled internally by the library. When you add documents to the index, Tantivy takes care of encoding the document IDs and storing them in the postings list. During search operations, Tantivy decodes the postings list to retrieve the document IDs efficiently.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Document IDs in Tantivy are serialized using delta encoding followed by Variable Byte Encoding.\n- Delta encoding reduces the size of the numbers to be stored, making them more compressible.\n- Variable Byte Encoding further compresses the delta-encoded values by using a variable number of bytes to represent each integer.\n- Tantivy handles the serialization and compression of document IDs internally, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.\n\nBy understanding these encoding techniques, you can appreciate how Tantivy optimizes the storage and retrieval of document IDs, contributing to its overall performance and efficiency.\nwhat is doc_freq?\nIn the context of information retrieval and search engines like Tantivy, `doc_freq` (document frequency) is a term that refe. It is a crucial metric used in various algorithms and calculations, including the computation of term weighting and relevance scoring.\n\n### Importance of Document Frequency\n\n1. **Term Weighting**: Document frequency is used in term weighting schemes such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). In TF-IDF, the inverse document frequency (IDF) component is calculated using the document frequency. The idea is to give higher weight to terms that are rare across the document corpus and lower weight to terms that are common.\n\n    - **TF-IDF Formula**:\n      \\[\n      \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{\\text{DF}(t)} \\right)\n      \\]\n      where:\n      - \\(\\text{TF}(t, d)\\) is the term frequency of term \\(t\\) in document \\(d\\).\n      - \\(N\\) is the total number of documents.\n      - \\(\\text{DF}(t)\\) is the document frequency of term \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Relevance Scoring**: Document frequency is used in relevance scoring algorithms to determine how important a term is in the context of a query. Terms with lower document frequency are considered more significant because they are less common and thus more likely to be relevant to the specific query.\n\n3. **Index Optimization**: Knowing the document frequency of terms can help in optimizing the index. For example, terms with very high document frequency might be treated differently to improve search performance.\n\n### Example in Tantivy\n\nIn Tantivy, you can access the document frequency of a term using the `Searcher` and `SegmentReader` APIs. Here's an example of how you might retrieve the document frequency for a specific term:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, Term};\nuse tantivy::query::QueryParser;\nuse tantivy::collector::TopDocs;\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram(schema.clone());\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 1\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 2\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Another example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 3\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Yet another example.\"));\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    // Search\n    let reader = index.reader()?;\n    let searcher = reader.searcher();\n    let term = Term::from_field_text(schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap(), \"example\");\n\n    // Get document frequency\n    let doc_freq = searcher.doc_freq(&term);\n    println!(\"Document frequency of 'example': {}\", doc_freq);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Schema Definition**: We define a schema with two fields: `title` and `body`.\n2. **Index Creation and Document Addition**: We create an in-memory index and add three documents to it.\n3. **Term Definition**: We define a term for which we want to retrieve the document frequency.\n4. **Document Frequency Retrieval**: We use the `Searcher` to get the document frequency of the term \"example\" in the \"body\" field.\n\n### Output\n\nThe output will show the document frequency of the term \"example\":\n\n```\nDocument frequency of 'example': 3\n```\n\nThis indicates that the term \"example\" appears in three documents.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Document Frequency (doc_freq)**: The number of documents in which a particular term appears.\n- **Importance**: Used in term weighting (e.g., TF-IDF), relevance scoring, and index optimization.\n- **Tantivy**: You can retrieve the document frequency of a term using the `Searcher` API.\n\nUnderstanding document frequency is essential for building efficient and effective search engines, as it plays a critical role in determining the relevance and importance of terms in search queries.\nGive me a breif on the `PostingsSerializer` and how does it actually serialize a docId with positions? I want to know how they are formatted, are they in continguous memory?\n### `PostingsSerializer` in Tantivy\n\nThe `PostingsSerializer` in Tantivy is responsible for serializing the postings list for a term. This includes the document IDs, term frequencies, and positions within the documents where the term appears. The serialized postings list is then stored in the index, allowing for efficient retrieval during search operations.\n\n### Serialization Process\n\nThe serialization process involves several steps to ensure that the data is stored compactly and can be efficiently accessed. Here's a high-level overview of how `PostingsSerializer` works:\n\n1. **Delta Encoding**: Document IDs are delta-encoded to reduce the size of the numbers, making them more compressible.\n2. **Variable Byte Encoding**: The delta-encoded values are then serialized using Variable Byte Encoding (VByte), which uses a variable number of bytes to represent each integer.\n3. **Position Encoding**: Positions within the documents are also delta-encoded and serialized.\n4. **Block-Based Storage**: The postings list is divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately. This allows for efficient access and decompression.\n\n### Example of Serialization with Positions\n\nLet's consider an example where the term \"example\" appears in three documents with the following positions:\n\n- Document 1: Positions [1, 4, 7]\n- Document 3: Positions [2, 5]\n- Document 7: Positions [3, 8, 10]\n\n### Delta Encoding\n\nFirst, we delta-encode the document IDs and positions:\n\n- Document IDs: [1, 3, 7]\n- Delta-encoded Document IDs: [1, 2, 4]\n\nFor each document, we also delta-encode the positions:\n\n- Document 1: Positions [1, 4, 7] -> Deltas [1, 3, 3]\n- Document 3: Positions [2, 5] -> Deltas [2, 3]\n- Document 7: Positions [3, 8, 10] -> Deltas [3, 5, 2]\n\n### Variable Byte Encoding\n\nNext, we use Variable Byte Encoding to serialize the delta-encoded values:\n\n- Delta-encoded Document IDs: [1, 2, 4]\n  - VByte: [0x01, 0x02, 0x04]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 1: [1, 3, 3]\n  - VByte: [0x01, 0x03, 0x03]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 3: [2, 3]\n  - VByte: [0x02, 0x03]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 7: [3, 5, 2]\n  - VByte: [0x03, 0x05, 0x02]\n\n### Block-Based Storage\n\nThe postings list is divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately. This allows for efficient access and decompression.\n\n### Contiguous Memory\n\nIn Tantivy, the serialized postings list is stored in contiguous memory to ensure efficient access and retrieval. This means that the document IDs, term frequencies, and positions are stored sequentially in the index file.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement the serialization process in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn encode_varint(mut value: u32) -> Vec<u8> {\n    let mut bytes = Vec::new();\n    while value >= 0x80 {\n        bytes.push((value as u8 & 0x7F) | 0x80);\n        value >>= 7;\n    }\n    bytes.push(value as u8);\n    bytes\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let doc_ids = vec![1, 3, 7];\n    let positions = vec![\n        vec![1, 4, 7],\n        vec![2, 5],\n        vec![3, 8, 10],\n    ];\n\n    // Delta encode document IDs\n    let deltas: Vec<u32> = doc_ids.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n        let delta = x - *state;\n        *state = x;\n        Some(delta)\n    }).collect();\n\n    // Serialize document IDs\n    let mut encoded_doc_ids = Vec::new();\n    for delta in deltas {\n        encoded_doc_ids.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n    }\n\n    // Serialize positions\n    let mut encoded_positions = Vec::new();\n    for pos_list in positions {\n        let deltas: Vec<u32> = pos_list.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n            let delta = x - *state;\n            *state = x;\n            Some(delta)\n        }).collect();\n        for delta in deltas {\n            encoded_positions.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n        }\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Encoded document IDs: {:?}\", encoded_doc_ids);\n    println!(\"Encoded positions: {:?}\", encoded_positions);\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **PostingsSerializer**: Responsible for serializing the postings list, including document IDs, term frequencies, and positions.\n- **Delta Encoding**: Reduces the size of the numbers, making them more compressible.\n- **Variable Byte Encoding**: Uses a variable number of bytes to represent each integer.\n- **Block-Based Storage**: Divides the postings list into blocks, compressing each block separately.\n- **Contiguous Memory**: Serialized postings list is stored in contiguous memory for efficient access.\n\nBy understanding the serialization process, you can appreciate how Tantivy optimizes the storage and retrieval of postings data, contributing to its overall performance and efficiency.\ncan you tell me how to postings list is structured with a diagram, I want to know how the doc Ids and positions are serialized in the postings list.\nCertainly! Understanding the structure of the postings list and how document IDs and positions are serialized can be quite insightful. Let's break it down step-by-step and visualize it with a diagram.\n\n### Structure of the Postings List\n\nA postings list in Tantivy is a data structure that stores information about which documents contain a particular term and where within those documents the term appears. The postings list typically includes:\n\n1. **Document IDs**: The unique identifiers of the documents that contain the term.\n2. **Term Frequencies**: The number of times the term appears in each document.\n3. **Positions**: The positions within the documents where the term appears.\n\n### Serialization Process\n\n1. **Delta Encoding**: Document IDs and positions are delta-encoded to reduce the size of the numbers.\n2. **Variable Byte Encoding (VByte)**: The delta-encoded values are serialized using Variable Byte Encoding.\n3. **Block-Based Storage**: The postings list is divided into blocks, and each block is compressed separately.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider an example where the term \"example\" appears in three documents with the following positions:\n\n- Document 1: Positions [1, 4, 7]\n- Document 3: Positions [2, 5]\n- Document 7: Positions [3, 8, 10]\n\n### Delta Encoding\n\nFirst, we delta-encode the document IDs and positions:\n\n- Document IDs: [1, 3, 7]\n- Delta-encoded Document IDs: [1, 2, 4]\n\nFor each document, we also delta-encode the positions:\n\n- Document 1: Positions [1, 4, 7] -> Deltas [1, 3, 3]\n- Document 3: Positions [2, 5] -> Deltas [2, 3]\n- Document 7: Positions [3, 8, 10] -> Deltas [3, 5, 2]\n\n### Variable Byte Encoding\n\nNext, we use Variable Byte Encoding to serialize the delta-encoded values:\n\n- Delta-encoded Document IDs: [1, 2, 4]\n  - VByte: [0x01, 0x02, 0x04]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 1: [1, 3, 3]\n  - VByte: [0x01, 0x03, 0x03]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 3: [2, 3]\n  - VByte: [0x02, 0x03]\n\n- Delta-encoded Positions for Document 7: [3, 5, 2]\n  - VByte: [0x03, 0x05, 0x02]\n\n### Diagram\n\nHere's a diagram to visualize the structure of the postings list:\n\n```\nPostings List for Term \"example\"\n--------------------------------\n| Document IDs | Term Frequencies | Positions            |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| 0x01         | 0x03             | 0x01, 0x03, 0x03     |\n| 0x02         | 0x02             | 0x02, 0x03           |\n| 0x04         | 0x03             | 0x03, 0x05, 0x02     |\n--------------------------------\n\nSerialized Postings List (in contiguous memory)\n-----------------------------------------------\n| 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04 | 0x03 | 0x01 | 0x03 | 0x03 | 0x02 | 0x03 | 0x03 | 0x05 | 0x02 |\n-----------------------------------------------\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Document IDs**: The document IDs are delta-encoded and then serialized using Variable Byte Encoding.\n2. **Term Frequencies**: The term frequencies indicate how many times the term appears in each document.\n3. **Positions**: The positions within each document are delta-encoded and then serialized using Variable Byte Encoding.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement the serialization process in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn encode_varint(mut value: u32) -> Vec<u8> {\n    let mut bytes = Vec::new();\n    while value >= 0x80 {\n        bytes.push((value as u8 & 0x7F) | 0x80);\n        value >>= 7;\n    }\n    bytes.push(value as u8);\n    bytes\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let doc_ids = vec![1, 3, 7];\n    let positions = vec![\n        vec![1, 4, 7],\n        vec![2, 5],\n        vec![3, 8, 10],\n    ];\n\n    // Delta encode document IDs\n    let deltas: Vec<u32> = doc_ids.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n        let delta = x - *state;\n        *state = x;\n        Some(delta)\n    }).collect();\n\n    // Serialize document IDs\n    let mut encoded_doc_ids = Vec::new();\n    for delta in deltas {\n        encoded_doc_ids.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n    }\n\n    // Serialize positions\n    let mut encoded_positions = Vec::new();\n    for pos_list in positions {\n        let deltas: Vec<u32> = pos_list.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n            let delta = x - *state;\n            *state = x;\n            Some(delta)\n        }).collect();\n        for delta in deltas {\n            encoded_positions.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n        }\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Encoded document IDs: {:?}\", encoded_doc_ids);\n    println!(\"Encoded positions: {:?}\", encoded_positions);\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Postings List Structure**: Contains document IDs, term frequencies, and positions.\n- **Delta Encoding**: Reduces the size of the numbers, making them more compressible.\n- **Variable Byte Encoding**: Uses a variable number of bytes to represent each integer.\n- **Contiguous Memory**: Serialized postings list is stored in contiguous memory for efficient access.\n\nBy understanding the structure and serialization process of the postings list, you can appreciate how Tantivy optimizes the storage and retrieval of postings data, contributing to its overall performance and efficiency.\nwhat is skip writer and what is skip list in postings list\n### Skip Lists in Postings Lists\n\nSkip lists are an optimization technique used in search engines to speed up the process of traversing postings lists. They allow the search engine to \"skip\" over large portions of the postings list, making it faster to find the relevant documents. This is particularly useful for terms that appear in a large number of documents.\n\n### Skip Writer\n\nA `SkipWriter` is a component responsible for creating skip lists during the indexing process. It writes additional metadata into the postings list that allows for efficient skipping during query execution.\n\n### Structure of Skip Lists\n\nA skip list is essentially a hierarchical index that allows for logarithmic time complexity for search operations. It consists of multiple levels, where each level contains pointers (or \"skips\") to positions further down the postings list. The higher the level, the larger the skips.\n\n### How Skip Lists Work\n\n1. **Basic Idea**: The basic idea is to divide the postings list into blocks and create pointers that allow the search engine to skip entire blocks of postings. This reduces the number of comparisons needed to find a specific document ID.\n\n2. **Levels**: Skip lists are organized into multiple levels. The bottom level is the original postings list, and each higher level contains pointers that skip over multiple entries in the level below.\n\n3. **Pointers**: Each entry in a skip list contains a pointer to a position further down the postings list. These pointers allow the search engine to quickly skip over irrelevant sections of the list.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a postings list for the term \"example\" with document IDs [1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]. A skip list might look like this:\n\n```\nLevel 2: [1, 7, 15, 25, 35]\nLevel 1: [1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]\n```\n\n### Skip Writer in Tantivy\n\nIn Tantivy, the `SkipWriter` is responsible for writing the skip list data into the postings list during the indexing process. This involves:\n\n1. **Determining Skip Points**: The `SkipWriter` determines the positions in the postings list where skips should be inserted. This is usually done at regular intervals.\n\n2. **Writing Skip Data**: The `SkipWriter` writes the skip data, including pointers to positions further down the postings list, into the index.\n\n### Skip List in Postings List\n\nThe skip list is stored alongside the postings list in the index. During query execution, the search engine uses the skip list to quickly navigate through the postings list.\n\n### Diagram\n\nHere's a diagram to visualize the structure of a skip list within a postings list:\n\n```\nPostings List with Skip List\n----------------------------\n| Doc IDs | Skip Pointers   |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| 1       | -> 7            |\n| 3       |                 |\n| 7       | -> 15           |\n| 8       |                 |\n| 10      |                 |\n| 15      | -> 25           |\n| 20      |                 |\n| 25      | -> 35           |\n| 30      |                 |\n| 35      |                 |\n----------------------------\n```\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement a skip list in Rust:\n\n```rust\nstruct SkipList {\n    doc_ids: Vec<u32>,\n    skip_pointers: Vec<usize>,\n}\n\nimpl SkipList {\n    fn new(doc_ids: Vec<u32>, skip_interval: usize) -> Self {\n        let mut skip_pointers = Vec::new();\n        for i in (0..doc_ids.len()).step_by(skip_interval) {\n            skip_pointers.push(i);\n        }\n        SkipList {\n            doc_ids,\n            skip_pointers,\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn search(&self, target: u32) -> Option<usize> {\n        let mut i = 0;\n        while i < self.skip_pointers.len() && self.doc_ids[self.skip_pointers[i]] <= target {\n            i += 1;\n        }\n        let start = if i == 0 { 0 } else { self.skip_pointers[i - 1] };\n        for j in start..self.doc_ids.len() {\n            if self.doc_ids[j] == target {\n                return Some(j);\n            }\n        }\n        None\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let doc_ids = vec![1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35];\n    let skip_list = SkipList::new(doc_ids, 3);\n\n    if let Some(pos) = skip_list.search(15) {\n        println!(\"Found document ID 15 at position {}\", pos);\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Document ID 15 not found\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Skip Lists**: An optimization technique that allows for faster traversal of postings lists by skipping over large portions of the list.\n- **Skip Writer**: Responsible for creating skip lists during the indexing process.\n- **Structure**: Skip lists are hierarchical and consist of multiple levels with pointers to positions further down the postings list.\n- **Efficiency**: Skip lists reduce the number of comparisons needed to find a specific document ID, improving search performance.\n\nBy understanding skip lists and the role of the `SkipWriter`, you can appreciate how Tantivy optimizes the traversal of postings lists, contributing to its overall performance and efficiency.\nhow are blocks used in postings list\n### Blocks in Postings Lists\n\nBlocks are a fundamental concept in the design of postings lists in search engines like Tantivy. They are used to group entries in the postings list into manageable chunks, which can then be compressed and accessed efficiently. The use of blocks helps optimize both storage and retrieval performance.\n\n### Why Use Blocks?\n\n1. **Compression**: By dividing the postings list into blocks, each block can be compressed separately. This allows for more effective compression, as the data within a block is often more homogeneous than the entire postings list.\n2. **Efficient Access**: Blocks allow for efficient access to the postings list. Instead of decompressing the entire postings list, the search engine can decompress only the relevant blocks.\n3. **Skip Lists**: Blocks work well with skip lists, as skip pointers can point to the start of blocks, allowing for efficient skipping over large portions of the postings list.\n\n### Structure of Blocks\n\nA block in a postings list typically contains:\n\n1. **Document IDs**: The document IDs for the documents in the block.\n2. **Term Frequencies**: The number of times the term appears in each document in the block.\n3. **Positions**: The positions within the documents where the term appears.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a postings list for the term \"example\" with document IDs [1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]. We can divide this postings list into blocks of size 5:\n\n```\nBlock 1:\n- Document IDs: [1, 3, 7, 8, 10]\n- Term Frequencies: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n- Positions: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5], [3, 8, 10], [1], [2, 6]]\n\nBlock 2:\n- Document IDs: [15, 20, 25, 30, 35]\n- Term Frequencies: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n- Positions: [[3], [1, 4], [2, 5, 8], [3], [1, 6]]\n```\n\n### Delta Encoding and Compression\n\nWithin each block, the document IDs and positions are delta-encoded to reduce their size. The delta-encoded values are then compressed using techniques like Variable Byte Encoding (VByte).\n\n### Skip Lists and Blocks\n\nSkip lists can be used in conjunction with blocks to allow for efficient skipping over large portions of the postings list. Skip pointers can point to the start of blocks, allowing the search engine to quickly navigate to the relevant block.\n\n### Diagram\n\nHere's a diagram to visualize the structure of blocks within a postings list:\n\n```\nPostings List with Blocks\n--------------------------\n| Block 1                |\n|------------------------|\n| Doc IDs: [1, 3, 7, 8, 10] |\n| Term Freqs: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2] |\n| Positions: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5], [3, 8, 10], [1], [2, 6]] |\n|------------------------|\n| Block 2                |\n|------------------------|\n| Doc IDs: [15, 20, 25, 30, 35] |\n| Term Freqs: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] |\n| Positions: [[3], [1, 4], [2, 5, 8], [3], [1, 6]] |\n--------------------------\n```\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement block-based storage in Rust:\n\n```rust\nstruct Block {\n    doc_ids: Vec<u32>,\n    term_freqs: Vec<u32>,\n    positions: Vec<Vec<u32>>,\n}\n\nfn encode_varint(mut value: u32) -> Vec<u8> {\n    let mut bytes = Vec::new();\n    while value >= 0x80 {\n        bytes.push((value as u8 & 0x7F) | 0x80);\n        value >>= 7;\n    }\n    bytes.push(value as u8);\n    bytes\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let blocks = vec![\n        Block {\n            doc_ids: vec![1, 3, 7, 8, 10],\n            term_freqs: vec![3, 2, 3, 1, 2],\n            positions: vec![\n                vec![1, 4, 7],\n                vec![2, 5],\n                vec![3, 8, 10],\n                vec![1],\n                vec![2, 6],\n            ],\n        },\n        Block {\n            doc_ids: vec![15, 20, 25, 30, 35],\n            term_freqs: vec![1, 2, 3, 1, 2],\n            positions: vec![\n                vec![3],\n                vec![1, 4],\n                vec![2, 5, 8],\n                vec![3],\n                vec![1, 6],\n            ],\n        },\n    ];\n\n    for block in blocks {\n        let mut encoded_doc_ids = Vec::new();\n        let mut encoded_positions = Vec::new();\n\n        // Delta encode and serialize document IDs\n        let deltas: Vec<u32> = block.doc_ids.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n            let delta = x - *state;\n            *state = x;\n            Some(delta)\n        }).collect();\n        for delta in deltas {\n            encoded_doc_ids.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n        }\n\n        // Delta encode and serialize positions\n        for pos_list in block.positions {\n            let deltas: Vec<u32> = pos_list.iter().scan(0, |state, &x| {\n                let delta = x - *state;\n                *state = x;\n                Some(delta)\n            }).collect();\n            for delta in deltas {\n                encoded_positions.extend(encode_varint(delta));\n            }\n        }\n\n        println!(\"Encoded document IDs: {:?}\", encoded_doc_ids);\n        println!(\"Encoded positions: {:?}\", encoded_positions);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Blocks**: Group entries in the postings list into manageable chunks for efficient compression and access.\n- **Compression**: Each block is compressed separately, allowing for more effective compression.\n- **Efficient Access**: Blocks allow the search engine to decompress only the relevant portions of the postings list.\n- **Skip Lists**: Work well with blocks, as skip pointers can point to the start of blocks for efficient skipping.\n\nBy understanding the use of blocks in postings lists, you can appreciate how Tantivy optimizes the storage and retrieval of postings data, contributing to its overall performance and efficiency.\nare the block size fixed in tantiby?\nIn Tantivy, the block size for postings lists is not fixed but is typically chosen to balance between compression efficiency and access speed. The block size can be configured based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. \n\n### Why Block Size Matters\n\n1. **Compression Efficiency**: Smaller blocks can be more effectively compressed because the data within a block is often more homogeneous. However, very small blocks might lead to higher overhead due to the metadata required for each block.\n2. **Access Speed**: Larger blocks reduce the number of blocks that need to be accessed, which can improve access speed. However, very large blocks might require more data to be decompressed, which can slow down access times.\n\n### Configurable Block Size\n\nTantivy allows for configurable block sizes to provide flexibility based on the application's needs. The block size is typically chosen to optimize the trade-off between compression efficiency and access speed.\n\n### Example Configuration\n\nWhile the exact configuration options might vary, here's a conceptual example of how you might configure the block size in Tantivy:\n\n```rust\nuse tantivy::schema::*;\nuse tantivy::{Index, IndexSettings, IndexWriter};\n\nfn main() -> tantivy::Result<()> {\n    // Define schema\n    let mut schema_builder = Schema::builder();\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"title\", TEXT | STORED);\n    schema_builder.add_text_field(\"body\", TEXT);\n    let schema = schema_builder.build();\n\n    // Create index with custom settings\n    let index_settings = IndexSettings {\n        docstore_compression: tantivy::store::Compressor::Brotli,\n        docstore_blocksize: 128, // Example block size\n        ..Default::default()\n    };\n    let index = Index::create_in_ram_with_settings(schema.clone(), index_settings);\n\n    // Create index writer\n    let mut index_writer = index.writer(50_000_000)?;\n\n    // Add documents\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 1\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"This is an example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 2\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Another example.\"));\n    index_writer.add_document(doc!(schema.get_field(\"title\").unwrap() => \"Example Document 3\", schema.get_field(\"body\").unwrap() => \"Yet another example.\"));\n    index_writer.commit()?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### How Block Size Affects Performance\n\n1. **Smaller Blocks**:\n    - **Pros**: Better compression efficiency, as the data within a block is more homogeneous.\n    - **Cons**: Higher overhead due to more metadata and potentially more blocks to access.\n\n2. **Larger Blocks**:\n    - **Pros**: Fewer blocks to access, which can improve access speed.\n    - **Cons**: Less effective compression and potentially more data to decompress during access.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\n- **Default Block Size**: Tantivy has a default block size that is chosen to provide a good balance for general use cases. This default can be overridden based on specific needs.\n- **Benchmarking**: It's often a good idea to benchmark different block sizes for your specific dataset and query patterns to find the optimal configuration.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Block Size**: In Tantivy, the block size for postings lists is not fixed and can be configured.\n- **Trade-offs**: Smaller blocks offer better compression efficiency but higher overhead, while larger blocks offer faster access but less effective compression.\n- **Configuration**: The block size can be configured based on the application's needs, and it's often beneficial to benchmark different configurations.\n\nBy understanding and configuring the block size appropriately, you can optimize the performance of your Tantivy-based search application for your specific use case.\n/file sstable/src","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":7565}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":7},"start":6,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":7566}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":41,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":7567}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":61},"start":97,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":7568}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":178},"start":4311,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"The final message must be from the user.
